# Marathi Tweet Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the code and resources for our project on sentiment analysis of Marathi tweets. This project, developed as part of Semester 5, explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand sentiments expressed in Marathi language tweets.

## Project Overview

In today's digital age, sentiment analysis has become a crucial tool in understanding public opinion and sentiment. This project specifically focuses on Marathi tweet sentiment analysis, aiming to decipher the emotions, opinions, and attitudes conveyed through tweets in the Marathi language.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to bridge the gap between the Marathi-speaking population and NLP applications. By understanding Marathi sentiments on social media, we can make informed decisions in various fields, including market research, brand management, and social listening.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses the challenge of sentiment analysis in Marathi text, dealing with the complexities associated with this regional language. We utilize a dataset of Marathi tweets to develop a model that can accurately classify sentiments expressed in these social media posts.

## Objectives

- Sentiment classification in Marathi tweets
- Rigorous model evaluation
- Exploration of practical applications of sentiment analysis in Marathi

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a comprehensive dataset of Marathi tweets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Data Encoding and Tokenization**: Encoding text data for model training.
4. **Model Selection**: Utilizing Indic BERT, a pre-trained model for Indian languages.
5. **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting the model to improve performance on our specific task.
6. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing tweets to classify sentiments.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall.

## Model Workflow

1. Data encoding and tokenization for the pre-trained model.
2. Sentiment analysis of tweets in Marathi.
3. Extracted tweet data and eliminated unnecessary symbols.
4. Altered the architecture using a pre-trained model.

## Results

The model's performance metrics are as follows:
- **Validation Recall**: 76%
- **F1 Score**: 75%
- **Precision**: 74%
- **Accuracy Score**: 75%

## Limitations

- **Limited Resources**: There aren't many tools and data available for understanding Marathi sentiment, which can make it harder to build accurate models.
- **Regional Variation**: Marathi speakers from different regions express feelings differently, affecting analysis accuracy.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our project has successfully navigated the complexities of Marathi tweet sentiment analysis. The understanding of Marathi sentiments and the impact of this analysis cannot be understated. Our work paves the way for a deeper exploration of regional languages in NLP, contributing to a more inclusive digital landscape.
